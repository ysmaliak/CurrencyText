CurrencyText provides lightweight libraries for formating text field text as currency, available for both `UIKit` and `SwiftUI`.

Its main core, the `CurrencyFormatter` class, can also be used _a part from text fields_ to format any value that can be monetary represented.

If you need to present currency formatted text or allow users to input currency data, `CurrencyText` is going to help you do it in a readable and configurable matter.

## Documentation

For details on how to use `CurrencyText` libraries please refer to [the docs](/documentation/Documentation.md).

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To install it using Swift Package Manager, just add this repository through Xcode built-in `Swift Packages`, or by manually adding it to your `Package.swift` Package's dependencies:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
    	url: "https://github.com/marinofelipe/CurrencyText.git", 
    	.upToNextMinor(from: .init(2, 1, 0)
    )
]

.target(
    name: "MyTarget",
    dependencies: [
    	// Can be imported to consume the formatter in insolation
        .target(name: "CurrencyFormatter"),

        // UIKit library - Provide access to "CurrencyFormatter" and "CurrencyUITextFieldDelegate" targets
        .target(name: "CurrencyText"),

        // SwiftUI library - Provide access to "CurrencyFormatter" and "CurrencyTextField" targets
        .target(name: "CurrencyTextSwiftUI")
    ],
    ...
)
```

### Install via CocoaPods

To integrate `CurrencyText` using CocoaPods, specify it, one or more of its sub-specs in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
# Podfile
use_frameworks!

target 'YOUR_TARGET_NAME' do
     pod 'CurrencyText'

     # sub-specs

     # pod 'CurrencyText/CurrencyFormatter'
     # pod 'CurrencyText/CurrencyUITextField'
     # pod 'CurrencyText/CurrencyTextField'
end
```
